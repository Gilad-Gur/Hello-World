Hello, my name is Gilad Gur, I'm 29 years old and I'm a computer science student in the Open University.
I'm also a musician and bassist and have been for 13 years. 
My passion is to discover new and interesting ideas and stories everyday.
Recently I started programming and writing code (mostly Java) and fell in love with it. The idea that writing a computer program to make the human life easier and more convinient or even to save lifes by it fascinates me.
Technology and modern life progresses everyday and I want to take part of this great community, the programmers community, that propel and develop almost all aspects of our life.
