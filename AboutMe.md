Hello, my name is Gilad Gur, I'm 29 years old and I study computer science in the Open University.
I'm also a musician and bassist and have been for 13 years. 
My passion is to discover new and interesting ideas and stories everyday.
Recently I started programming and writing code (mostly Java) and fell in love with it. The idea of writing a computer program to make the human life easier and more convinient or even in some cases saving lifes by it fascinates me.
Technology and modern life progresses everyday and I want to take part of this great community, the programmers community, that propel and develop almost all aspects of our life.

So feel free to check out my projects and comment, add or do anything you think that will benefit us.
Cheers ;-)
